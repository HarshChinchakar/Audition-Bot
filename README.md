# Automated Audition Analysis

Automated Audition Analysis is an AI‑powered evaluation system designed to streamline the audition and casting process by reducing the manual workload of watching, scoring, and shortlisting candidate performance videos. The system provides structured and objective grading across multiple artistic parameters while preserving human‑centric decision making.

This solution accelerates casting workflows with consistent performance evaluation, detailed scoring, and autogenerated report cards — making auditions faster, sharper, and scalable without compromising nuance.

---

##  Core Objective

Instead of manually reviewing every audition, the system analyzes each candidate video and generates an evaluation report containing:

* Objective category‑based scores
* Performance rationale and improvement suggestions
* Summary report and analytics ready for internal review

---

##  How It Works — High‑Level Workflow

```
1. Upload candidate video audition (MP4)
2. (Optional) Upload reference benchmark performance or script
3. AI evaluates performance across predefined artistic categories
4. Scores + professional feedback generated
5. Report card exported (JSON/Text)
6. Multiple reports aggregated for analytics and shortlisting
```

---

##  Key Evaluation Categories

Each audition is analyzed across artistic and cinematic dimensions including:

| Area                                  | Sub‑Metrics                                                |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Facial Expressions & Emotions         | Detected emotions, micro‑expressions, consistency          |
| Gestures & Body Language              | Gesture quality, expressiveness, physical coordination     |
| Voice & Speech                        | Clarity, modulation, pacing & rhythm, emotional inflection |
| Stage Presence & Character Engagement | Authenticity, emotional impact, screen presence            |
| Timing & Delivery                     | Scene flow, synchronization, dramatic arc                  |

The tool outputs:

* Score breakdown (out of 10 per category)
* Metric table summarization
* Written reasoning and suggestions for growth
* Candidate summary card
